# Solution

To find your friend and pick him up in a finite amout of time, you need to follow the following steps:

**1- Pick a direction (either backward or forward)**

**2- Start driving in that direction for a specific amout of time (eg: 20 mins)**

**3- If you didn't find your friend while driving in that direction then turn around and start driving for double the time you specified before**

**4- Repeat step 3 till you find your friend**

With this approach, you can definitely find your friend in a finite amout of time, because you can cover the most ground in both directions.
